# usefulvbscript

VBS files that I have developed for work that do various useful things.

SCRIPT Update File .xls to .xlsx
^ Sometimes you have a folder full of .xls files and you'd like to change them to .xlsx files.
^ Put this VBS file into a folder, run the script and click OK.
^ All .xls files will be opened, saved as a .xlsx file, then the .xls file is moved to the LegacyArchive folder
^ At the end a log text file is created to show all changes made.
