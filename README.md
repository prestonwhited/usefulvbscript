# usefulvbscript

VBS files that I have developed for work that do various useful things.

<b><u>SCRIPT Update File .xls to .xlsx</u></b>
<br>~ Sometimes you have a folder full of .xls files and you'd like to change them to .xlsx files.
<br>~ Put this VBS file into a folder, run the script and click OK.
<br>~ All .xls files will be opened, saved as a .xlsx file, then the .xls file is moved to the LegacyArchive folder.
<br>~ At the end a log text file is created to show all changes made.
